Tensorflow installation on PYNQ FPGA

In this tutorial, we have presented the steps of installing Tensorflow 1.1.0 on PYNQ FPGA’s “pynq_z1_image_2016_09_14” OS. And exploring some basic project with tensorflow. This tutorial gives you an idea of how to install the TensorFlow on PYNQ FPGA Board and do the basic testing with it. Here is the basic test after installation of Tensorflow.
